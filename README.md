Over the past few years, the topic of sustainability has gained a lot of attention. It is well known that in order to preserve the planet for future generations, sustainability needs to be implemented in everyday life. Therefore, a lot of companies have started to implement sustainability into their organizations. This can even be beneficial for companies, as if they are able to implement good sustainability practices and adequately diffuse them towards their stakeholders, it can in the medium term become a source of competitive advantage and as a consequence lead to value creation (Sicoli, Bronzetti & Baldini, 2019). 

The industry with the most need for sustainable practices is the fashion industry. The overall fashion industry, when it comes to the production of clothes, has displayed one of the highest levels of negligence concerning exploitation of the workforce, social well-being and drainage of the worlds natural resources (Henninger et al., 2019). Luckily, new trends have emerged in the fashion industry which could decrease its negative environmental impact. One of such trends is the utilization of second-hand clothing. Second-hand clothing leads to environmental and financial advantages as it reduced the material, water usage, production costs, and landfill spaces needed to create new clothes (King & Wheeler, 2016). As a consequence, the trade of second-hand clothing has highly increased over the past few years through consumer-to-consumer platforms such as *Vinted*, *Facebook Marketplace*, and *Marktplaats*, or through business-to-consumer platforms such as *Sellpy* and *Thredup*. What all these platforms have in common is that they are specifically dedicated to the sale of second-hand items. 

In more recent years, a new trend has started to emerge, namely existing clothing brands re-selling their own brand’s clothes previously owned by consumers. Examples of this are *Zalando’s “Pre-owned”*, *NA-KDs “Tweedehands”* and *Xan Woman’s “Pre-loved”*. Buying and selling second-hand clothes via such websites, can be interesting and beneficial for consumers for several reasons. Firstly, it increases the trustworthiness. Reasons why consumers do not buy second-hand clothing is because of product quality and cleanliness concerns and the social image of clothes being perceived as low-class and having low social acceptance (Hur, 2020). As consumers have already bought from the store before, they know the quality and type of clothes they can expect. Secondly, there is a financial benefit for consumers. When selling back their clothes to these websites, consumers get a fixed and guaranteed amount of money. In contrast, when selling their clothes to consumers themselves, there is a high chance that they are unable to sell it, due to no demand. Moreover, it saves them shipping costs as they can send all their clothes at once to the same address. 

For this dataset, it was chosen to focus on the website *Zalando* in The Netherlands, more specifically their *“Pre-owned”* section. Zalando started to offer this feature on their website in The Netherlands in October 2020 (Duurzaam Ondernemen, 2020). Compared to the previously mentioned websites, Zalando is an interesting choice as it offers clothes from more than 4500 brands, whereas a lot of other stores only sell their own brand. With this dataset it could for example be investigated which brands are mostly offered for second-hand clothing, which sizes and types of products are most popular, and the pictures that are used to sell the products. When comparing this data over a period of time, new trends can be analyzed and it can be determined whether it is beneficial for a clothing store to offer their own clothes as second-hand. Moreover, as Zalando offers its products in more than 14 countries, the dataset of The Netherlands could be compared to other countries to see if there are country-specific differences.
